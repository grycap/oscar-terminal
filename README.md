# Ghostty Web Terminal with OSCAR CLI

This crate deploys an OSCAR exposed service that provides a browser-based terminal powered by `ghostty-web`. The terminal runs inside the service container and includes `oscar-cli`, `tmux`, and a standard Bash shell.

The service is intended to be deployed per user. By default, the launcher reads the OSCAR service access token from the mounted service FDL and reuses it as the terminal access token, so the browser login token matches the service token managed by OSCAR.

The container can also preconfigure `oscar-cli` against the in-cluster OSCAR API by injecting an OIDC refresh token as a secret.

## What the container provides

- `ghostty-web` frontend with a PTY-backed WebSocket session
- `oscar-cli` preinstalled in the container image
- `tmux` for optional session management inside the terminal
- Persistent workspace backed by a mounted MinIO bucket

## Workspace persistence

The example `fdl.yml` mounts the bucket path `/ghostty-web` from `minio.default` into `/mnt/ghostty-web` inside the container. The launcher script uses `WORKSPACE_DIR` directly as the working directory and also stores shell history plus `oscar-cli` user config there.

Keep `mount.path` and `WORKSPACE_DIR` aligned if you want to bind a different bucket or prefix for each user.

## Build the image

Run the build from the crate root so the Dockerfile can copy `script.sh` and the files under `docker/`:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/grycap/ghostty-web:0.1.0 .
```

Push the resulting image to the registry you plan to use and update `fdl.yml` if needed.

## Deploy with OSCAR CLI

Base deployment:

```bash
oscar-cli apply fdl.yml
```

Before deploying, replace the placeholder secrets in `fdl.yml`:

- `OSCAR_OIDC_REFRESH_TOKEN`: OIDC refresh token used by `oscar-cli`

Persistent workspace:

1. Edit `fdl.yml`
2. Set `mount.path` to the bucket or prefix you want to expose in `/mnt`
3. Apply the file again

## Access the terminal

After deployment, access the service through:

```text
https://<OSCAR-ENDPOINT>/system/services/<service-name>/exposed/?token=<service-token>
```

On first access, the server validates the token, issues an `HttpOnly` session cookie, and redirects the browser to the same URL without the `token` query parameter. The WebSocket terminal then reuses that cookie.

When `OSCAR_OIDC_REFRESH_TOKEN` is set, the startup script generates `~/.oscar-cli/config.yaml` with a default cluster that points to the in-cluster OSCAR service endpoint:

```yaml
oscar:
  local-cluster:
    endpoint: http://oscar.oscar.svc.cluster.local:8080
    oidc_refresh_token: <refresh-token>
    ssl_verify: false
default: local-cluster
```

## Notes

- This crate assumes one deployed instance per user.
- The service is stateful from the user's point of view if a bucket is mounted, even though the exposed service itself runs as a single pod.
- If your OSCAR cluster expects `port` instead of `api_port` in the `expose` block, replace that key accordingly.
- The launcher reads the token from `/oscar/config/function_config.yaml` by default. You can override that path with `OSCAR_SERVICE_FDL_PATH`.
- If the launcher cannot read a token from the OSCAR FDL, it falls back to `TERMINAL_TOKEN` if that environment variable is already present.
- If neither the OSCAR service token nor `TERMINAL_TOKEN` is available, the application-side authentication is disabled and the terminal becomes publicly accessible.
- The generated `oscar-cli` config is written to `~/.config/oscar/config.yaml` inside the container and uses mode `0600`.
- If you mount `/mnt`, the workspace can persist independently from the in-container credentials. Review whether you want the generated CLI config to persist together with that workspace.
